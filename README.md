> Omics Central Viz, a React component UI graphing library.

## Get Started

Use in your project:

```bash
$ npm i omics-central-viz
```

## Development and Storybook

To start, clone this repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/singha53/omics-central-viz
$ cd omics-central-viz
```

I used Storybook to test the components. To run the local server, simply run:

```bash
$ npm i
$ npm run storybook
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001) to view your stories. They should automatically update as you develop.
